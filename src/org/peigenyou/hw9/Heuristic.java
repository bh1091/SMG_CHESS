   * should return first states where a piece was captured, because a capturing move has the
   * potential of being better than a simple move without capture. <br>
   * Moreover, the heuristic can decide not to even return some possible moves if they are obviously
   * "bad", or if they are duplicates (e.g., in backgammon for a 5-6 roll, we return both 5->6,
   * 6->5, or directly moving 11 points. If the 3 options result in the same final state, then it is
   * enough to consider just one of the moves). Another example is the doubling-cube move that we
   * should not consider in our simple AIs. <br>
   * The return type is {@code Iterable} and not {@code List} because we might not need all the next
   * states due to pruning. For example, if alpha-beta pruning cut of a branch we can stop iterating
   * over the next states.<br>
