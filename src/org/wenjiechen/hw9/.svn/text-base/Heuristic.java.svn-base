   * should return first states where a piece was captured, because a capturing move has the

   * 6->5, or directly moving 11 points. If the 3 options result in the same final state, then it is
   * enough to consider just one of the moves). Another example is the doubling-cube move that we
   * should not consider in our simple AIs. <br>
   * The return type is {@code Iterable} and not {@code List} because we might not need all the next
   * states due to pruning. For example, if alpha-beta pruning cut of a branch we can stop iterating
   * over the next states.<br>
